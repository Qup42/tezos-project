* who would be the speaker(s) - Name(s) and affiliation(s)

Speaker: Peter Thiemann, University of Freiburg, Germany

* a short bio of the speaker(s) (to be used by the moderator at the beginning of the presentation, and when advertising the video)

Peter Thiemann is a full professor at the computer science department
of the University of Freiburg where he leads the programming languages
research group.  His research interests comprise theory and practice
of modern programming languages, in particular typing, program
analysis, and program transformation. The focus of his recent research
is on gradual typing, advanced type systems for communication, and
their application in the setting of blockchains.

* title of the presentation

The Power of Disagreement

* a few lines of abstract (something that would urge the reader to attend or  watch ;-) )

Distributed consensus is a fundamental technique to validate the next
block in a blockchain network. Once consensus is reached, every
network node can check the validity of every block.
We turn this approach upside-down and study a technique to probabilistically
validate an assertion by challenging the network to find a
refutation. If a refutation is found, every node can check it. If no
refutation is found, the network accepts the assertion as unrefuted.
We explain the principles behind our technique and outline an
implementation in the Tezos blockchain.
