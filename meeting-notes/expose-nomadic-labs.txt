* a short bio of the speaker(s) (to be used by the moderator at the beginning of the presentation, and when advertising the video)

Peter Thiemann is a full professor at the computer science department
of the University of Freiburg where he leads the programming languages
research group.  His research interests comprise theory and practice
of modern programming languages, in particular typing, program
analysis, and program transformation. The focus of his recent research
is on gradual typing, advanced type systems for communication, and
their application in the setting of blockchains.

* title of the presentation

On Oracles and Contract Modules

* a few lines of abstract (something that would urge the reader to attend or  watch ;-) )

Oracles are a means of connecting the outside world with the
blockchain. An oracle can provide a trusted reference to a real-world
object or it can provide triggers for contracts on the blockchain.
We study the means to provide high-quality oracles on the Tezos
blockchain and offer two approaches: a type-safe contract API and
contract modules.
