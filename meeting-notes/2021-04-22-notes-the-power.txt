The power of disagreement

Distributed consensus is a fundamental technique to validate the next
block in a blockchain network. Once consensus is reached, every
network node can check the validity of every block.
We turn this approach upside-down and study a technique to probabilistically
validate an assertion by challenging the network to find a
refutation. If a refutation is found, every node can check it. If no
refutation is found, the network accepts the assertion as unrefuted.
We explain the principles behind our technique and outline an
implementation in the Tezos blockchain.
